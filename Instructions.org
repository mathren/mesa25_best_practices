#+title: Late massive star evolution: physics challenges to numerics
#+author: [[mailto:mrenzo@arizona.edu][Mathieu Renzo]]

* Minilab 1

Massive star models become numerically more challenging as they
evolve. Issues manifest as plummeting timesteps below any threshold.
Broadly speaking, these issues can be seeded in either "the core"
(where nuclear burning of heavier elements stiffens the equations)
and/or "the envelope" (where small timesteps result in waves and
occasionally spurious artificial accelerations). The two kind of
issues can also interact non-linearly with each other, resulting in
the majority of a grid crashing.

*Note:* this is not exclusively a "MESA" problem, but a result of the
physics being described by progressively stiffer equations that are
numerically more challenging to solve. This is why most (but notably
not all) stellar evolution codes stop at C core depletion at the
latest.

** The starting point
*Task 1*: Download the =15Msun_problem= folder from [[https://github.com/mathren/mesa25_best_practices/tree/main][gitHub]].

:Hint:
Download from git the repo for this lecture and get into the folder
with the following =bash= one-liner (*N.B.:* =&&= is a =bash= "and", which
will execute the second command only if the first exits successfully):
#+begin_src bash
git clone git@github.com:mathren/mesa25_best_practices.git && cd mesa25_best_practices/15Msun_problem
#+end_src
:end:

We will use a simple model of a 15M_{\odot} star (see [[./15Msun_problem][the work directory]]) to
illustrate these problems. In the interest of speed, we will use a
22-isotope network and we have already evolved it beyond carbon core
depletion (model number =1261=).

*Note:* If you are interested in creating pre-SN models to study whether
stars explode or not (and with what energies), you want to properly
capture the free electron /profile/, which determines the effective
Chandrasekhar mass of the core and thus its structure. Specifically,
you want your results to be robust against adding more isotopes in
your nuclear reaction network. For this, you need at least \sim80
isotopes (e.g., [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJS..227...22F/abstract][Farmer et al. 2016]], [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024RNAAS...8..152R/abstract][Renzo et al. 2024]], [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250300115G/abstract][Grichener et
al. 2025]]). If you are interested in the nuclear neutrino
luminosities, for example for SN precursor alerts, you need at least
\sim200 (e.g., [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496.3961K/abstract][Kato et al. 2020]], [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...893..133F/abstract][Farag et al. 2020]]). If your science
doesn't depend on the core structure, you may get away with small
nuclear reaction networks.

:Hint:
You can inspect the [[./15Msun_problem/early_evolution.mp4][pgstar movie]] to see your initial conditions.
:end:

Ideally, we want to be able to run this to the onset of core collapse,
but again for summer school purposes, let's just try to get beyond
oxygen depletion and call it a success.

*Note:* =min_timestep_limit= is set to 0.1 seconds, too high for
production models past O core burning, but it's sufficiently low that
one may not want to continue the evolution in testing, and in this
particular case, we have tested that blindly lowering the
=min_timestep_limit= down to =1d-20= will not bypass this issue.

** Common situation: Running into a problem
*Task 2:* After initializing MESA and running =./clean && ./mk= start from
the provided photo (=photos/x261=).

:Hint:
Without an argument =./re= will restart from the last photo saved on the
disk, which should still be =x261=, and you can use the command line
=touch= to update the time of last edit of a =photo= to trick MESA. We
have modified the =./rn= bash script to add an extra check in case you
really want to start from the beginning. *This is not something you
should do during this lab*.
:end:

The main =inlist= points to =inlist_problem= which is at this point is the
same as =inlist_early_evol= (use to create the pre-computed initial
conditions) except for the stopping criterion.

*Note:* It's not exactly a bare-bone model, but definitely not
science-ready!

Watch your model evolve. The terminal output is often the quickest way
to get an idea of what's going on, but it may scroll too fast to look
at it. You can *pause (without killing) the run with =Ctrl-Z= and resume
it typing* =f g=.

At model =1266= you should hit the =hydro_failed= condition.

At this point, for an individual model I may fiddle a bit to find a
work-around (e.g., fiddling with increasing resolution, decreasing
=min_timestep_limit=), but that can often become a messy random walk in
the forest of MESA parameters. Sometimes, a problem cannot be worked
around and needs to be fixed.

** But what is the problem?
The terminal output indicates that MESA took a series of =retries=
before hitting =hydro_failed=.

The output also says that there has been 133 of these =retry=, (not all
at this specific timestep though). A =retry= means that the proposed
solution of the ODEs you are solving is not good enough (left and
right hand-side still differ too much, the difference is called
*residual*), prompting MESA to =retry= from the initial conditions of the
previous timestep with a smaller timestep size.

Another useful information is the value of =s% solver_call_number=, in
this case =1399=, which differs from the model number (here =1266=)
precisely because of the retries. This is the call to the solver that
resulted in the =hydro_failed=.

Let's collect more output about this.

*** MESA's debugging output
We will instruct MESA to provide debugging output we don't normally
want to see. To do this we will use a particular set of =controls= in
out inlist, which are described in the MESA documentation at
=$MESA_DIR/star/defaults/controls.defaults/= or [[https://docs.mesastar.org/en/latest/developing/debugging.html#step-1-activate-debugging-options][online]], and also
collected for convenience in
=$MESA_DIR/star/test_suite/debugging_stuff_for_inlists=. Don't worry, we
won't need to use /all/ of this!

*Task 3a (optional):* Copy the content of this file in your
=inlist_problem= in the =controls= namelist (or "section"). Everything is
commented (=!= in Fortran 90, used also in the inlists which are not
proper Fortran files).

*Task 3b*: Uncomment and set to =.true.= the =report_solver_progress=
control and restart the run again.

:Hint:
The line you need to add to your =controls= namelist is the following:
#+begin_src fortran 90
  report_solver_progress = .true.
#+end_src
and then =./re= to restart.
:end:

The run now produces more output per timestep, and thus scrolls faster
(but you can still pause it with =Ctrl-Z=, restart with =fg=), but apart
from that we haven't changed anything and it should crash in the same
way.

The solver call that crashes shows this:

#+DOWNLOADED: screenshot @ 2025-06-04 15:28:20
[[file:.org_notes_figures/Late_massive_star_evolution/2025-06-04_15-28-20_screenshot.png]]

Which is described in the MESA documentation [[https://docs.mesastar.org/en/latest/developing/debugging.html#step-2-run-the-model-and-find-the-bad-spot][here]]. After a line
declaring the current solver call number (=1399=), which "gold"
tolerance level we are applying, the reporting on each solver
iteration starts.

The line starting with =tol1= tells the level of tolerances currently
applied, if no solution can be found, this is relaxed to =tol2= and
later =tol3= after a set of user-specified number of solver iterations.

For the lines produced at each iteration, the first column says the
current timestep (=1266=), the second shows the solver iteration number
for the current call (=1=, =2=, ...). The most important things for us are
the column containing =equ=-something and the column following =max corr=.

=equ= is the name that MESA gives to the residuals, as you can verify
checking the definitions in =$MESA_DIR/star_data/public/=. This is the
place where all variables available to MESA are defined.

*Task 4*: Using =grep= (or similar tools) you can look for =equ= here and
see if anything useful comes up, you should find something to help you
understand what this is.

:Hint:
  Sometimes I do this from the =$MESA_DIR= directory if I don't know
  where to start from, it's only more work to weed out output you
  don't need.
:end:

:Hint:
This is the =bash= command I used and the result for me:
#+begin_src bash
  grep -R "equ" $MESA_DIR/star_data/public/*
#+end_src
Which produces this output:

  star_data/public/star_data_step_work.inc:         ! ublk(i,j,k) = dequ(i,k)/dx(j,k+1)
#+end_src

Specifically, the 5^{th} line from the bottom shows that =equ= is an array
of dimensions (=nvar=, =nz=) where =nvar= is the number of variables ($P, T,
\rho, X_{i}$, ....) and =nz= is the number of zones. The line just above shows
a comment that suggests this is indeed the array of residuals.
:end:

Thus, the =equ= column tells us which residual is largest for the
proposed and rejected solution:, in this case initially it's =equ_he4=
at iteration 1 of the solver, it can change at every iteration, until
at the end it is =equL=. This is the thing that is making our model
crash. Moreover, scrolling upward through the solver iterations we see
that the residual (4^{th} but last column) is jumping from negative to
positive from iteration =20= to iteration =21=. Finally, during these
iterations, =lnd= (that is, physically, the density) is the problematic
variable. At each iteration of the solver (shown as a line here), MESA is
searching for a solution with a Generalized Newton-Raphson solver (see
sec. 6.3 of [[https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0067-0049/192/1/3][Paxton et al. 2011]]): the iterative corrections to an
initial guess (the solution of the previous timestep) depend on the
derivatives of the residuals with respect to the variables (see excellent
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method#/media/File:NewtonIteration_Ani.gif][wikipedia gif]] for intuition on this).

*Note:* Unless the timestep is too small, the initial guess is usually
not a good solution in many different ways, and which residual is
initially largest among many too large values is not particularly
important. The lines with the latest solver iterations are the most
important here.

So the correct way to interpret this output is that the equation =equL=
cannot be satisfied within the defined numerical tolerances of the
Newton-Raphson solver. This in general can occur because of multiple
reason (and potentially requiring different fixes/work-arounds), for
example:
- an assumption of the equation is violated (\Rightarrow maybe you want to
  reformulate the equation differently, often there are options
  already available in MESA or you can implement your own with
  =run_star_extras.f90=)
- too large numerical errors introduced in the discretization (\Rightarrow
  remeshing before the problem arise can help)
- One or more inputs or parameters of the equation are too noisy
  (\Rightarrow you may need to remesh based on a quantity different than the one
  calculated by the problematic equation).

Moreover, the terminal output also shows that the residual =equL= has a
bad derivative with respect to the variable =dens= in the last line.

But what is the equation for which the residual is =equL=? One would
naively assume a luminosity equation given the name! However, in MESA
the luminosity is a solver variable and there isn't really a
"luminosity equation" (except for the local energy conservation).

*Task 5:* Let's use tools such =grep= to inspect the code to find out what
=equL= may be.

:Hint:
This is a one liner to find all the instances of =equL= in the folder
=MESA_DIR,= regardless of capitalization (=-I= option, Fortran 90 doesn't
care!) and recursively (=-R= option) including only =*.f90= files
(=--include= option):

#+begin_src bash
      grep -IR --include="*.f90" "equL" $MESA_DIR
#+end_src

It looks like it appears in the file
=$MESA_DIR/star/private/hydro_temperature.f90= (among others).
:end:
In fact, =equL= is a short hand for =s%equ(i_equL, :)= which is assigned
in =$MESA_DIR/star/private/hydro_temperature.f90= at line 274 by this
snippet:

#+begin_src fortran 90
   gradT = s% gradT_ad(k)
   dlnTdm = dlnPdm*gradT

   Tm1 = wrap_T_m1(s,k)
   T00 = wrap_T_00(s,k)
   dT = Tm1 - T00
   alfa = s% dm(k-1)/(s% dm(k-1) + s% dm(k))
   Tpoint = alfa*T00 + (1d0 - alfa)*Tm1
   lnTdiff = dT/Tpoint ! use this in place of lnT(k-1)-lnT(k)
   delm = (s% dm(k) + s% dm(k-1))/2

   resid = delm*dlnTdm - lnTdiff
   s% equ(i_equL, k) = resid%val
#+end_src

which suggests that =equL= *is the residual of the temperature gradient
equation*, not a (non-existing) luminosity equation. See also [[https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0067-0049/192/1/3][Paxton et
al. 2011]] Sec. 6.2 (specifically Eq. 8).

Why this name then? In a star, the temperature gradient will adjust to
carry the luminosity (leading to convection if the radiative gradient
is insufficient). So we can use the luminosity to calculate the
temperature gradient. However, it is numerically convenient to flip
things, and use the temperature gradient equation to obtain the
luminosity instead: ultimately =equL= is about the luminosity, but the
equation it is the residual of is the temperature gradient equation.

**** *Optional*: confirming the bad derivative
To confirm that it is the derivative of the residual =equL= with respect to
the density =lnd= is behaving bad, let's get some info about those
by uncommenting and setting in our inlist the following:

#+begin_src fortran 90
solver_test_partials_call_number = 1399
solver_test_partials_iter_number = 21
solver_test_partials_k = 21
solver_test_partials_equ_name = 'equL'
solver_test_partials_var_name = 'lnd'
solver_test_partials_dx_0 = 1d-5
#+end_src

*Note:* At this stage you may also want to set
=solver_save_photo_call_number= equal to the solver call of the problem
(in our case =1399=) so MESA will save a =photo= just before this solver
call, saving you time to debug.

This tells MESA we want more output at solver call number =1399=, we
want to inspect the =21= iteration of the solver, and we want to see the
partial derivatives of the luminosity equation with respect to =lnd=. *This will
also make MESA crash right after that iteration of the solver*: you
will need to undo these changes to continue. Scroll up to see the
output:

which confirms that the suspected partial derivative is the culprit of
the problem!

*** So this is the (first) problem!

The derivative of the residual of the equation for the temperature
gradient, a.k.a. =equL= with respect to the variable =lnd=, the density is causing
flip-flopping large corrections to the trial solution and preventing
the solver from finding a satisfying solution. This suggest the
calculation of this derivative is too imprecise -- this may not
advance us so much, but at least we know which equation is giving us
numerical troubles!

*Note:* Sometimes it easier to spot problems making plots, or staring at
=pgstar=. The technique illustrated here is a last resort when
plotting and physical plus numerical intuition are not enough to get out of
a hole.

*Note:* This technique is general and can be used for any model
crashing. Once you've identified the problem, the solution will
typically need to be tailored to that specific problem.

** Finding a solution

There may be more than one! This is where computing stellar structure
and evolution models is a bit of an art: experience from
trial-and-error and /many/ wasted CPUh is the best way to become
proficient at finding solutions and/or work-arounds.

Since the problem is in =equL=, one naive thing one can do is to ignore
the residuals of those equation. In fact, there is a =controls= flag to
do this in MESA: this suggests this is a common enough problem!

*Task 6*: Find the flag that may help us and add it to =inlist_problem= (and
maybe remove the debug options we previously activated to reduce I/O).
Then restart the run.

:Hint:
Look in =$MESA_DIR/star/defaults/controls.defaults= or in the
[[https://docs.mesastar.org/en/latest/reference/controls.html][online documentation]] to see if you find a suitable flag.
:end:

:Hint:
You can search the file (with =grep=, similar tools, or your text
editor) for =convergence_ignore= to find suitable options
:end:

:Hint:
Try adding this to the =controls= namelist of your inlist:
#+begin_src fortran 90
    convergence_ignore_equL_residuals = .true.
#+end_src
:end:

This is of course *not* an elegant solution to be used with extra care
only if acceptable for your scientific purposes.

However, note that the test suite for massive stars does use it! See
for example
=$MESA_DIR/star/test_suite/20M_pre_ms_to_core_collapse/inlist_common=!

Even worse, if you search in the =test_suite= for
=convergence_ignore_equL_residuals=, you will find many more instances
of this setting being used! Are we giving up on solving the energy
transport/temperature gradient equation all these times?

*Task 7*: find all instances of the =controls= setting in the
=$MESA_DIR/star/test_suite=

:Hint:
Below is a one-liner that you can use from anywhere in your terminal
to get the output above assuming =MESA_DIR= is initialized. It will go
to the =test_suite= directory then (after =&&=), use =grep= to look for the
string in between quotes recursively (=-R=), and the lastly go back to
the previous folder where you were (=cd -=):
#+begin_src bash
  cd $MESA_DIR/star/test_suite && grep -R "convergence_ignore_equL_residuals = .true." ./* && cd -
#+end_src
Which gives me:

#+end_src
:end:

In =$MESA_DIR/star/private/hydro_temperature.f90=, where we previously
found the definition of =equL=, we can see a useful comment:

#+begin_src fortran
 ! dT/dm = dP/dm * T/P * grad_T, grad_T = dlnT/dlnP from MLT.
 ! but use hydrostatic value for dP/dm in this.
 ! this is because of limitations of MLT for calculating grad_T.
 ! (MLT assumes hydrostatic equilibrium)
 ! see comment in K&W chpt 9.1.
#+end_src

So according to this, the equation we are trying to solve assumes
hydrostatic equilibrium *because* it implicitly rely on mixing length
theory (MLT) to get \nabla = =gradt_T=.

At the same time, most test cases where we find
=convergence_ignore_equL_residuals = .true.= seem to imply some
dynamical phase of evolution (massive stars going to core collapse,
flashes, etc.): if your model is not perfectly in hydrostatic
equilibrium, there is no reason to expect that this equation can be
solved perfectly, because one of its implicit assumptions is not
exactly verified.

This is what allows this "dirty trick" without having to throw away
all the possible science!

*Note:* The fact that we ignore the residual in =equL= does not imply this
equation will necessarily not be satisfied, we are just telling the
solver that we are willing to accept solutions with large residual,
and we hope that the numerical tolerances on other quantities will
give a reasonable answer even if numerically not perfect.

If everything went well, the run should now proceed past model =1266=:
you have successfully bypassed the problem! This model should continue
until Oxygen depletion (defined as $X_{c}(^{16}\mathrm{O})\le 10^{-5}$). *Congratulations!*

*Bonus task 1*: You can edit the stopping condition in your
=inlist_problem= to evolve past Oxygen depletion. You may also want to
decrease the =min_timestep_limit= to something smaller than 1 second. A
second crash should occur during Si core burning. You can use the
things you learned in this lab to find the problem and try to fix it.
Remember that the nuclear reaction network we are using here is
insufficient for science focusing on the core of evolved massive
stars!

*Bonus task 2*: Find an alternative possible solution by reformulating
the problematic equation (*Note:* this is untested by us!). You probably
don't want to change which system of ODE you are solving on the fly
(although there are exceptions, for example when a very massive star
approaches pair instability you may want to change the momentum
equation!), so you may need to restart the model from ZAMS.

:Hint:
Use =grep= in the =$MESA_DIR/star/defaults/= folder to efficiently skim
the documentation off-line based on keywords.
:end:

:Hint:
Focus on =$MESA_DIR/star/defaults/controls.defaults=, this file
typically contains the settings specifying form of equations and
numerical tolerances.
:end:

:Hint:
Search for =T_gradient= to see the other available options!
:end:


*Bonus task 3*: Change the nuclear reaction network to =mesa_204.net= and
try to push this model to the onset of core collapse. If you succeed,
do a resolution test! If the quantities of interests are resolved, you
may have a science-grade setup now! (*Note:* do not attempt this *during*
the school, it will take too much computing time! This is also
untested by us.)

** After you found the solution

If your solution implies changing at some point something in the setup
(e.g., any inlist entry changing the physics or numerics) you should
either:
1. re-run from the beginning, to verify that the introduced change does
   not make the model crash earlier or change any interpretation of the
   results earlier in the evolution (if not, you may want to run from
   ZAMS with the fix you just found)
2. if that is not possible and you're willing to change something
   "on-the-fly", try to implement this as a change from
   =run_star_extras.f90=.

While option 1. is desirable, it is not always possible, plus,
sometimes you may be willing to turn off some physics that acts on
timescales long compared to the remaining lifetime (e.g., thermohaline
mixing past C depletion), or relax some numerical criteria when things
get too hard.

Option 2. can be done for example using the =extras_start_step= function
in =run_star_extras.f90=: add an if statement to catch "when" in the
evolution the change should happen (e.g., based on central abundances
or temperature) and change the values of entries in =controls= through
the =s%= pointer. For example, to change =max_model_number= (a =controls=
setting), you can overwrite your =inlist= with:

#+begin_src fortran 90
   s% max_model_number = 1260
#+end_src

There are some examples of doing these in the =test_suite= and from
reproducible publications on [[https://zenodo.org/communities/mesa/records?q=&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=newest][zenodo]]! See for example
=$MESA_DIR/star/test_suite/make_co_wd/src/run_star_extras.f90= or
=$MESA_DIR/star/test_suite/ppisn/src/run_star_extras.f90= for examples.

*N.B.:* you can also use =b %= in the MESA =binary= module to change things
 of =binary_controls=.

Option 2. at least will minimize the amount of hand-holding required
for your models.

** Wrap up

The main point of this exercise was to teach how to access and read
debugging output at a specific iteration of the solver during a MESA
run. This can reveal which equation and which variables are causing
troubles.

Very often, at this point, one needs to consider what is the root of
the issue to fix it. Some issues are common, known, and still awaiting
a general fix, so we sometimes chose that it's ok to ignore them,
which is what we have done here - while not recommended in general,
this is sometimes acceptable, especially during development.

Hopefully, what you have learned here can be helpful if further
problem arise, and more generally. As you've seen, this is a significant
amount of work, and often you can use intuition to take short cuts
through this process.

Before diving into debugging options, to identify the problem, the
first thing is to make plots. It is quick and often useful to look at
=pgplots=. Very often, with a bit of physical intuition and experience
one can identify the problem just looking at the model.

*N.B.:* At this stage, you may want to look at variables you don't
necessarily focus on for your science: sometimes it's things you don't
care about that grind your model(s) to a halt! Stellar evolution is a
highly non-linear problem. Sometimes changing axes (quantities and
scale) to change perspective also helps.

=pgplots= may not be that pretty to look at, but they can be very
helpful to spot problems and depending on your science case you may be
able to afford a band-aid solution. But sometimes you need to know
what is the root cause, which equation is yielding the largest
residual and driving the decrease in timesteps.

*** Full solution minilab1

An inlist with the full solution is provided as a hidden file
=.inlist_solution_minilab1=. You can rename it and/or point your main =inlist= to
it. MESA will read a hidden file!

:Hint:
Open the main =inlist= and change every instance of the string
=inlist_problem= with =.inlist_solution_minilab1=

*N.B.:* don't forget the period at the *beginning* of the second string!
